# Cutting-edge Content Generation with GAN, SSGAN, WGAN, and VAE

Welcome to the "GAN" repository, where we delve into the exciting world of neural networks for content generation. In this repository, you will discover the power of GAN, SSGAN, WGAN, and VAE models for creating and enhancing various types of content. 

## Overview

The neural networks included in this repository are designed for specific tasks:

- **GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)**: Generates realistic images by pitting two neural networks - generator and discriminator - against each other.
  
- **SSGAN (Semi-Supervised GAN)**: Improves the quality of generated content by leveraging labeled and unlabeled data for training.
  
- **WGAN (Wasserstein GAN)**: Ensures stability in training by using the Wasserstein distance metric to measure the difference between generated and real data distributions.

- **VAE (Variational Autoencoder)**: Compresses data into a dense latent space and learns features for tasks like image generation and fraud detection.

## Applications

The applications of these neural networks are diverse and impactful:

- **Image Generation**: Create realistic and high-quality images for various purposes, such as art, design, and entertainment.
  
- **Quality Enhancement**: Improve the quality of images, videos, or other content by generating enhanced versions based on existing data.
  
- **Fraud Detection**: Utilize feature learning and data compression capabilities of VAE to detect anomalies and fraudulent activities in datasets.
